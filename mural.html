            <h3>Situation and Complications</h3>
            <p style="margin:0;">In the midst of the pandemic, I joined MURAL during a hyper-growth stage on a new team building and re-imagining areas of the product. No other designer had worked on any features for a few years in our product area, so there was little insight into decisions that were previously made. I was the only designer for the first 6 months working across 3 product teams within a pillar focused on personalization features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Resolution</h3>
            <p style="margin:0;">I became responsible for scaling our design process to work across various teams and help enable other roles to make design decisions when necessary. I helped onboard another designer to collaborate across the 3 teams.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p style="margin:0;">Our team built and released over 5 new features and has run 10+ experiments, testing hypotheses using A/B and multi-variant testing. Our teams are working in one-week sprints to create more effective alignment across product, design, and engineering. 

            <br>We continually iterated our design process to be more inclusive of product managers and engineers. Understanding the data that surrounds a problem is key for deciding our solution. We have worked with our engineers to provide the right tools and context to make quick design decisions that are aligned with our product vision and principles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Design Sprint: Home</h3>
            <p style="margin:0;">When I first joined (Jan 2021) we ran a traditional Design Sprint to better understand the potential of the area of the product we were newly formed to focus on. We instantly had many insights and learnings from the customer feedback to investigate over the next few months. This sprint really set us up to turn into the team we are now, the Personalization team. Focusing on building a personalized experience with data.</p>

            <h3>Testing Algorithms</h3>
            <p style="margin:0;">Over the next few weeks, we knew we wanted to better understand how we could personalize people’s Home page experience by providing them with the right content at the right time. We began with the algorithm to start creating a weighted score system to rank customer’s content. We tested this algorithm internally and with customers to understand the accuracy of the early MVP.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Home layout experiments</h3>
            <p style="margin:0;">Once we had a refined data set to use, we began exploring various design layouts to understand how people prefer seeing their content. I created a few layout options that created different hierarchies using grid and list views. I exported a JSON file from our data team to hook straight into the Figma files so I could iterate all 5 layouts with one click to change the content with each customer's real data. We had a control of the current experience to test against in the usability tests.</p>

            <h3>Home MVP</h3>
            <p style="margin:0;">Through all the learning and experimentation to improve the workspace experience we finally launched an MVP of Home into MURAL. We have seen an improvement in our key metrics. We are already experimenting and iterating on this version and its relationship with other features within the product.</p>
