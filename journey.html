            <h3>yours in type</h3>
            <h2>the desire for more</h2>
            <p style="margin:0;">My journey into design began through typography. I was fascinated by how different typefaces could convey distinct narratives and emotions. Paula Scher's innovative approach to branding and typography has been a significant influence on my work. During my B.F.A. in design, the industry underwent a dramatic digital transformation thanks to smartphones. This shift led me to pursue UX design, where I focused on crafting digital brand experiences. I found myself drawn to understanding user decision-making processes, working to create intuitive pathways across systems. However, I soon realized I wanted to make a deeper impact—to build essential tools and services rather than focus solely on marketing and advertising.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>finding values</h3>
            <h2>how design harms</h2>
            <p style="margin:0;">As I deepened my understanding of design's influence, I discovered how often it was being wielded as a tool for manipulation. However, I realized that design itself was merely the conduit—it was people making conscious decisions to prioritize metrics like conversions, brand value, and downloads over human well-being. I wanted to redirect my expertise in UI, UX, and product strategy toward more meaningful pursuits. While I understood this transformation wouldn't happen overnight, I needed to establish clear ethical principles to guide my path forward—like guardrails keeping me aligned with my values and preventing me from straying off course.</p>

            <h3>social work</h3>
            <h2>Pursuing MSW</h2>
            <p style="margin:0;">In 2023, I began exploring what initially appeared to be an antithesis of technology: social work. This discipline, focused on addressing the fundamental needs of individuals, families, and communities, surprisingly echoed familiar themes from my design background. I was particularly drawn to how the social work profession is anchored in core values—emphasizing human dignity, social justice, and service. Their code of ethics provides clear accountability for both individuals and organizations in pursuing these goals. As I delved deeper, I discovered that social work and design share more common ground than I had imagined. <br><br> This realization led me to the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm now pursuing my Master of Social Work. My goal is to work at the intersection of technology and social policy, leveraging my decade of design expertise to create meaningful social impact.</p>
